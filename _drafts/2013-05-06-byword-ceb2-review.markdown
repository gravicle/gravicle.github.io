title: Byword β review
---
<p>I had some time with the β and I love the publishing feature. A few things I noticed:</p>

<ol>
<li>In the &quot;Publishing Preferences screen, icons in the list aren&#8217;t retina optimized. http://cl.ly/OmvF</li>
<li>For posting to Wordpress blogs, the &#8220;Post Format&#8221; selector is getting increasingly more important. Bloggers like Vitici and myself are using it for link-blogging. I am glad that you added the ability to set &#8220;Custom-Fields&#8221;; it&#8217;d be even better if you can identify and display custom-fields which already exist in functions.php (Poster on iOS does this).</li>
<li>The β broke my Alfred workflow to preview things in Marked. Even a system-wide service shortcut would not work. I believe, as stated in release notes, this is a consequence of Sandboxing. Could there be better Marked integration in the app? Less clunky than how UIII does it, but on similar lines. Marked is quite essential to my workflow. I use it to do some custom stuff to my HTML like adding anchor-links to each paragraph and light-box class to images. Even when not doing all that, preview in Marked is just great! (I have also defined a custom stylesheet to mimic my blog and thus Marked shows exactly how things would look on http://spinhalf.net).</li>
</ol>

<h3>Fonts:</h3>

<p>I have lately been using monospaced fonts for writing even in Byword for Mac. My favorite here is Menlo Regular at 15pts. So, I love the new font choices in the iOS β.</p>

<p>I find 16pt to be the best font-size for all the 4 fonts on the iPhone. However, there is a lot of padding on the iPhone. the Screen is pretty tiny itself and padding further eats into it. I really like the padding in the current public release. On the iPad, I have always wanted to send feedback on the padding. With regular fonts, the padding looks nice, however, with monospaced fonts, which have large char and word spaces, please consider reducing the padding to about 75% of what it currently is.
Also, some font-specific suggestions:</p>

<ol>
<li>AtlasTypewriter: This is my favorite of the 4 fonts, but word-spacing is quite extreme. Looks really scattered.</li>
<li>FedraMonoPro: Again, on the iPhone a little reduction in word-spacing might look better.</li>
<li>FedraAltSans: I think the character spacing is too little. A tiny increase might make the font look a bit less busy.</li>
</ol>

<p>Another thing I want to note, and this isn&#8217;t specific to the beta: while creating lists following a paragraph, one has to leave a blank line or the list will not be parsed as a list in HTML export. I understand the limitation comes from MD. However, a visual clue for this in syntax highlighting could help avoid such mistakes. For instance, if I forget to leave a line blank, Byword does not dim the list bullets/numbers. This way I know that the current list isn&#8217;t being parsed right by ByWord and I need to fix something.</p>
