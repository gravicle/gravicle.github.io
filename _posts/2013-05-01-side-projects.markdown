<p>Aaron Mahnke on side projects:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Side projects aren’t all roses and puppy dogs, but they certainly leave us better off when it’s all said and done. Learn from your exploration, and turn it into an asset.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Side projects are crucial. They are our fickle sides trying be something, our curios selves trying to be someone. While work obligations are fenced avenues we <em>must</em> channel our lives into, side projects are little treads on the dirt road which, sometimes, pave a new way of life. They keep us hungry. They keep us foolish.</p>
