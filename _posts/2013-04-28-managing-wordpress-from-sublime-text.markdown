<p>So this happened today. I subscribed to Brett Terpstra&#8217;s RSS feed and in there was a little post: <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2013/04/19/web-excursions-for-april-19-2013/">Web Excursions for April 15, 2013</a>. Terpstra had linked to a <a href="https://github.com/dnstbr/sublpress">Sublime Text package</a> that allows one to blog from within Sublime Text to Wordpress. I installed, it connected and WHOA!</p>

<p>This is really huge for me. I hate using the web-interface of Wordpress (though a <a href="http://spinhalf.net/wordpress-new-responsive-dashboard/">recent beta update</a> is charming) and Mars Edit is sort of ugly. Now, I can write in Byword, Preview in Marked, copy HTML and paste in Sublime to publish/edit<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a>. Incredible.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<hr />
<ol>

<li id="fn:1">
<p>It lets you do a lot more. You can change a lot of Wordpress settings, manage pages, upload media. There will be an ever lessening need to log-in into the web-interface. <a href="#fnref:1" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>
</li>

</ol>
</div>
