title: 1.1 Billion Dollars of Not Screwing It Up

<p>I have to admit, I was <a href="https://twitter.com/gravicle/status/336160745555378179">sad</a> about Yahoo! acquiring Tumblr. It wasn&#8217;t all unwarranted. Yahoo! isn&#8217;t exactly the one with a track record for execution and all it takes to screw-up a vibrant community-driven product like Tumblr is to just sit on it. However, as the day comes to close, things are starting to look a lot different.</p>

<p><a href="http://marissamayr.tumblr.com/post/50902274591/im-delighted-to-announce-that-weve-reached-an">Marissa Meyer&#8217;s announcement letter</a> for the acquisition starts like this (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’m delighted to announce that we’ve reached an agreement to acquire Tumblr! </p>

<p><em>We promise not to screw it up</em>. Tumblr is incredibly special and has a great thing going. We will operate Tumblr independently. David Karp will remain CEO.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While David Karp ends <a href="http://staff.tumblr.com/post/50902268806/news">his</a> quite like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As always, everything that Tumblr is, we owe to this unbelievable community. We won’t let you down.</p>
<br/>
<p>Fuck yeah,</p>
<p>David</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both the companies seem very cognizant of the &#8220;screwing-up&#8221; that might ruin Tumblr. More importantly, the objective of the deal seems to resonate: &#8220;<strong>Tumblr gets better faster</strong>&#8221;. This is a good sign.</p>

<p>Talking of good signs, <a href="http://blog.flickr.net/en/2013/05/20/a-better-brighter-flickr/">Flickr got an overhaul</a> today. While I haven&#8217;t yet spent a lot of time on it, it looks amazing. The timing of the update is impeccable and unmistakable. As Ben Thompson <a href="http://stratechery.com/2013/a-better-brighter-flickr/">puts it</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Flickr redesign was either just finished, or held until this day. It doesn’t matter which it is: finishing by today means internal teams are learning to execute; holding it is even more impressive. It shows that management understood what this announcement could mean [&#8230;], had the patience to sit tight, and the discipline to not leak (too much). Both bode well for Tumblr.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With Tumblr, Flickr and the new <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yahoo!-weather/id628677149?mt=8">Yahoo! Weather</a> app, I believe we are finally seeing Marissa Meyer&#8217;s Yahoo!.<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> I wish them the very best<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a>.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s with punctuations in the names of companies? <em>Tumblr.</em>, <em>Yahoo!</em>, <em>Toys&#8220;R&#8221;Us</em>, <em>E*TRADE</em>. It&#8217;s weird people. What if there were people named <em>Da*vid</em> or <em>Angela!</em> !? <a href="#fnref:1" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>
