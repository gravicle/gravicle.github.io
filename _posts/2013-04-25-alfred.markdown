<p>I have been using the Mac intensively and at times, exclusively, for the past few months. Most of it involves sessions of writing HTML/CSS or spending hours pouring over Obj-C and the Cocoa-Touch documentation. I have also been writing a little bit. All of this, especially web development, involves accessing a lot of files and apps very frequently. And I have been getting increasingly frustrated with having to look for each graphic and dig thru folders. What is even more cumbersome is performing repetitive actions inside apps. Spotlight does help but it goes only so deep into the problem. The tipping point came last night at 3 am when I just gave up on finder and spotlight. This morning, the first thing<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> I did was <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com">download Alfred</a>. Oh. My. God.</p>

<p>I have to confess something to Gabe Glick. I am an idiot for having ignored a launcher for so long, despite his (multiple) suggestions. Alfred is incredible. It is cli-like access to the entire mac and almost anything you regularly do on the internet. With an incredibly open and vibrant community, there was nothing that I could think of for which a workflow did not already exist. </p>

<p>The most important reason I like Alfred is because it streamlines <em>so much</em> of what I do on my mac behind a few keystrokes. I certainly prefer it over having to remember a ton of increasingly bizarre keyboard shortcuts. Alfred provides a text-interface to anything you can think of. The speed gains lie in not having to locate interface-elements to perform various actions. You don&#8217;t have to load Amazon to search it. You don&#8217;t have to click on 5 buttons and press shortcuts to create a new document. It is so fast and so simple. So much so that it gets Spotlight&#8217;s ⌘+Space shortcut on my Mac (while Spotlight itself is now an alternative with ⌥+Space).</p>

<p>Here, I am listing my workflows and what I use them for and where you can download them. I assimilated all of this, just this morning in about 2 hours.</p>

<h3>Defaults</h3>

<p>Since my primary motivation for using Alfred was to speed up access to files and folders, in the &#8220;Default Results&#8221;, I pick Contacts, Preferences, Folders, Text files</p>

<h3>Web Search</h3>

<p>There are a lot of built in keywords for accomplishing searches across the internet. As of right now, I turned most keywords into single letter prompts. For instance, <em>g</em> for Google or <em>w</em> for Wolfram Alpha. I have also added two custom searches. </p>

<ul>
<li>Search the <strong>iTunes store</strong>

<ul>
<li>Keyword: <em>it</em></li>
<li>Search URL: <code>itms://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZSearch.woa/wa/com.apple.jingle.search.DirectAction/search?term={query}</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Search the <strong>Mac AppStore</strong>

<ul>
<li>Keyword: <em>mas</em></li>
<li>Search URL: <code>macappstore://ax.search.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZSearch.woa/wa/search?q={query}</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>These are all pretty trivial. Where Alfred&#8217;s real strength lies is in custom Workflows. These searches, as well, can be enhanced significantly with workflows that can grab search suggestions.</p>

<h3>Workflows</h3>

<p>Alfred has a massive, <em>massive</em> library of user-developed workflows. <a href="http://www.alfredworkflow.com">alfredworkflow.com</a> is a partial compilation of all the major workflows. There is also a <a href="https://github.com/hzlzh/Alfred-Workflows/raw/master/Downloads/Workflow-Searcher.alfredworkflow">workflow to find more workflows</a>! Here are the ones I am using.</p>
