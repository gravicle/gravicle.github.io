Horace Dediu lists 4 questions he would like answered by Tim Cook at next week's D11 conference. Basically, they deal with iPhone's lack of variations, carrier penetration, Apple's unusually high cap-ex in 2012 and reliance on Samsung. Such a great set. A lot can be learnt about Apple by asking these questions.
