<p>Google's design guidelines are very good, not in a light way either. Most designers I spoke to today seem very impressed and by just looking at Google's mockups, it makes me want to make something of that flavor. There are some rough edges but that is to be expected from such a new paradigm. So, does this mean Android is going to be pretty now? Well yes and no.</p>

<p>Stock Android will look a lot better and so will apps from good, thoughtful developers. This still leaves a huge swath of apps behind which will continue to be written in PhoneGap or other horrid tools. It also leaves out carrier apps which are spam-loaded onto every device. There is little hope there.</p>

<p>What would it take to execute this monumental shift in design on Android? For one, better toolchain from Google that affirms first-party tools and reduces (if not eliminates) the need for alternative IDEs. Apple can move mountaints becuse it controls the stack, Google doesn't. This also comes into play when you look at the hardware that Android runs on. Material Design, like iOS 7, emphasizes GPU intensive animations and fluid transitions. While top-of-the-line Android devices ship with ok graphics, there is a massive swath of Android devices which are being launched/sold today that compare with iPhone 4 in hardware specs and that relic from 2010 <em>cannot</em> play animations!</p>

<p>Should iOS designers, developers, users be worried that Android is now good at design? Non-sense. For one, this is a <em>document</em>, a set of guidelines. Execution is everything and Google still has to prove itself on that front. Second, it is generally good for technology that the most used operating system is finally becoming presentable. It will induce a sense of design sensibility in makers and create a demand for higher quality wares in users. That is good for everybody. Honestly, if Android wasn't around, there would be nothing pushing iOS.</p>
