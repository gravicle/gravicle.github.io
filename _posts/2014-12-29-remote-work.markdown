> In a region that prides itself on disruption and working from first principles, San Francisco’s scaling problem is pretty humorous if you look at it from the outside: otherwise smart and inventive founders continue to set up offices and try to hire or move people in the most overheated environment since there were carphones in Cadillac Allantes. This is where I feel like Paul Graham misses the most obvious solution to the problem. [∞](http://ma.tt/2014/12/how-paul-graham-is-wrong/)

Well, yes. Cities have faced scaling issues since the dawn of time. It's also true that solutions like Slack and Google Hangouts make this time unlike others in the past. However, there is something to be said about in-person collaboration and workspaces which spur spontaneous inetractions. Working as a part of a great remote team, I can attest that there is simply nothing that stands in the way of a distributed functional office environment today, however, the pinch of just sitting in a room with someone and whiteboarding is a lacuna.

This is even more evident when looking beyond software teams. Hardware engineering is still nearly impossible to accomplish online alone. So are diciplines which require physical spaces like a lab. Until we have holodecks, this will be the case.

So, yes, while distibuted teams are a possibility and even a great solution at times, they do not address the problems caused by the current immigration policies.
