Frankly, they won't! They didn't last year. So, we know now, specs don't matter. Build quality doesn't matter. Even the OS is immaterial given that most other non-Apple phones all run Android. It begs the question, how do people even buy phones anymore? What is the inspiration behind their choice?

Ads? Brand? Random pick?

I am losing interest now.
