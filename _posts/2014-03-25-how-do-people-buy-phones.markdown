HTC might have revealed another <em>great</em> phone this week. Build quality looks incredible, specs excellent, and OS clean.

Frankly, they won't! They didn't last year. So, we know now, specs don't matter. Build quality doesn't matter. Even the OS is immaterial given that most other non-Apple phones all run Android. It begs the question, how do people even buy phones anymore? What is the inspiration behind their choice?

Ads? Brand? Random pick?

I am losing interest now.
