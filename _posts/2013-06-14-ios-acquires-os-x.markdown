<p>There have been two very interesting inverse-acquisitions and a third one is on the horizon<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li>NeXT acquired Apple: While technically it was the other way around, philosophically, NeXT overtook Apple and brought in Steve who ripped apart the incredulous non-sense that plagued the Apple of the 90s. NeXTSTEP went-on to become the core of OS X which revitalized the Mac and allowed Apple enough financial headroom to do the iPod in 2001. NeXTSTEP is still at the heart of OS X and, more importantly, iOS.</li>
<li>Pixar acquired Disney: This one was way more skewed than NeXT and Apple. Pixar was tiny compared to the aging behemoth that was Disney in 2006. Pixar enamored Disney with its philosophy of <em>innovation for emotion</em>. Today, Disney owes Pixar for bringing it back from the brink of the &#8220;What would Walt do&#8221; epidemic.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, we are at the cusp of one such inverse-acquisition, another philosophical one at that. Beginning with OS X Lion, Apple has been bringing things &#8220;Back To The Mac&#8221;. A week ago, iOS 7 took a sharp left turn into a new realm of visual and interaction design and the Mac is set to follow suit. But this time, things will not be &#8220;<em>Patched</em> to the Mac&#8221;.</p>

<p>iOS was derived from OS X by vehement stripping down of aspects that were deemed inessential to mobile. Now, OS X will be stripped down of the &#8220;cruft&#8221; and will be enveloped by this philosophy of clean, efficient, and content-focused design which originated in iOS 7. </p>

<p>Apple will no more have two separate OSes.</p>

<p>Apple will have two different instances of iOS very thoughtfully crafted for different use cases. </p>

<p>And then, iOS will have acquired OS X.</p>
