Brent Simmons [makes a point](http://inessential.com/2014/10/10/the_risk_of_products_failing) about indie apps and developers which can be true in some cases. However, my experience has been not that black and white. Individual developers and small shops have the advantage of working on things which bigger companies couldn't ever justify and this brings immense value to any ecosystem. However, only a few sustain their apps. Most (rightly) move on to other things if the app isn't a run-away success (most aren't!) while it's possible that it still has a core group of users who swear by it. Unread is an example, amongst many. Only today, the news of Glassboard being shut down broke. Now, Glassboard was something that was used by some of the most influential people in the industry. It didn't make business sense and it's going away.

The point I am trying to make is that indie apps and projects aren't any *safer* or less vulnerable than software from bigger enterprises. If anything, bigger development houses have the resources to see a project thru periods of slump and explore alternative strategies before stuttering anything. However, be it an app from Apple or John Appleseed, at the end, what goes up must come down.
