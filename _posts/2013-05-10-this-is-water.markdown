A beautiful adaptation of David Foster Wallace's Kenyon College commencement speech. 


<blockquote>It is about the real value of a real education, which has almost nothing to do with knowledge, and everything to do with simple awareness; awareness of what is so real and essential, so hidden in plain sight all around us, all the time, that we have to keep reminding ourselves over and over:

"This is water."

"This is water."
</blockquote>
