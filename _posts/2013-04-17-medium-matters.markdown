<p>I have been very fascinated with <a href="https://medium.com">Medium</a> as of late. Great design and even better writing. Today, they <a href="https://medium.com/stories-that-matter/c41584ab5fcf">acquired</a> <a href="https://www.readmatter.com">MATTER</a>, &#8220;a publication based around a new way to create really great long-form journalism about science, technology and the future.&#8221;</p>

<p>I have for long believed that journalism is a function of the medium it is conceived in. It matters where you start. Traditional newspapers can adapt for the web but they will never be native unless they change who they are<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a>. It is no surprise to me that efforts to bring print to the web have only <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/dec/03/news-corp-close-ipad-the-daily">foiled</a>.</p>

<p>The internet is agile and beautiful. It has its own design paradigms, its own language. If you are looking for great writing on the web, look for publications which were born here, in the digital realm, envisioned by people for whom the internet is not an afterthought. As Ev Williams of Medium <a href="https://medium.com/about/9e53ca408c48">puts it</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s not too late to rethink how online publishing works and build a system optimized for quality, rather than popularity. Where anyone can have a voice but where one has to earn the right to your attention. A system where people work together to make a difference, rather than merely compete for validation and recognition. A world where thought and craftsmanship is rewarded more than knee-jerk reactions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My current favorites, besides Medium and MATTER, are <a href="http://the-magazine.org">The Magazine</a>, <a href="https://svbtle.com">Svbtle</a> and parts of <a href="http://theverge.com">The Verge</a> <a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a></p>

<p>I am referring to the culture and structure of publications. The <em>people</em>, the journalists themselves, are still invaluable. <a href="#fnref:1" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

<p>I especially like The Verge&#8217;s <em><a href="http://www.theverge.com/features">Features</a></em> section. Some of my favorite pieces:
