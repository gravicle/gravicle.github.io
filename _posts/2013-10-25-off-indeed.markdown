<p>We cannot pretend to know much of what&#8217;s going on at Apple. With their very limited public exposure, Keynote events are the times when we try to grasp onto every little bit of inference that can be drawn and data that can be gathered. Sometimes, it might happen that we just end-up reading too much into things.</p>

<p>However, I believe I agree with Marco&#8217;s assessment of the Oct 22 Keynote event which saw the unveiling of the iPad Air and a Retina Mini alongside some really nice updates to the Mac lineup and the launch of the fabled Mac Pro.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The presenting executives seemed a bit off, too. Their energy was flat, as if Apple wasn’t particularly excited about these announcements either (with the notable exception of Craig Federighi, who was properly energized and most polished). Most of the jokes and digs at competitors were awkward. The lines were so tightly scripted that the presenters often stumbled off-script slightly, and rather than rolling with it naturally, they’d just jump back and awkwardly retry the line. Nothing about the speeches seemed natural — at best, the presentation felt uptight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There were many times when they stumbled on lines and corrected things. This is out of ordinary for Apple events. While people have stuttered on the stage before, the frequency and the way it was handled this time just felt under-rehearsed and edgy. Schiller felt very forced to me and there wasn&#8217;t much excitement beyond Federighi&#8217;s OS X demo. iPad launch felt a lot like Schiller going through a feature checklist.</p>

<p>I cannot even speculate about the reasons. They might just not find all these incremental updates as interesting as what&#8217;s in the works. Or, they might just think that these presentations don&#8217;t carry that much weight anymore. Or they might be having an off-day<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>If that&#8217;s the reason, I will blame Carl Icahn. I am sincerely concerned about him and his effect on Apple. I believe Apple will hold its ground and not relent to his <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20131024/icahn-to-apple-i-want-a-150-billion-buyback-now/">greedy and almost-malicious demands</a>. <a href="#fnref:1" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>
