<p>Wired has that some-customers-are-whining-about-Adobe&#8217;s-business-model-change <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/05/adobe-creative-cloud-petition/?cid=co7887814">story</a>. I was just waiting on it. The point is, all the whining and kicking of feet is in vain. Adobe is a specimen of a monopoly. There is no <em>viable</em> alternative to Photoshop<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> and even Illustrator<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a> and if you&#8217;re already using these two, it&#8217;s just easy to stay within the ecosystem where there is seamless importing of formats. For users, there is nowhere else to go. So, as long as Adobe stays within the bounds of reason with its pricing, subscription or not, it will not have its cash-flow dry. This makes now to be a great time to switch to a more stable, but atypical and slightly radical model.</p>

<p>Pixelmator and GIMP have been steadily improving but currently there is no matching 20 versions worth of iteration and features of Photoshop. PS is a suite in itself. It caters to a very wide audience which hires it for a wide array of solutions. An alternative might have all the <em>major</em> features but it&#8217;s the niche tools that make PS so indispensable. <a href="#fnref:1" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

<p>On the vector-drawing front, there are a lot of good alternatives. While no one app can replace Illustrator, a collection of a few like <a href="macappstore://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sketch/id402476602?mt=12&amp;uo=4">Sketch</a>, <a href="macappstore://itunes.apple.com/us/app/idraw/id404705039?mt=12&amp;uo=4">iDraw</a> and <a href="macappstore://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pixelmator/id407963104?mt=12&amp;uo=4">Pixelmator</a> can just do the trick. However, it is a giant pain to coordinate between apps and to remember which app does what best. So functionally, Illustrator, as of today, stands to be the only app of its caliber.  <a href="#fnref:2" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>
