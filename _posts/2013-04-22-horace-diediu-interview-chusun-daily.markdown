<p>Horace Dediu is the smartest, most prolific person <a href="http://www.asymco.com">writing</a> or <a href="http://5by5.tv/criticalpath">speaking</a> about Apple today. As an analyst, his observations and conclusions are incredibly insightful. It&#8217;s an avalanche of &#8220;aha!!&#8221; moments.</p>

<p>In an <a href="&quot;http://www.asymco.com/2013/04/22/interview-with-chosun-daily-of-korea-about-apple/">interview</a> with Chosun Daily, Horace reasons about the <a href="http://spinhalf.net/aapl/">irrational shock</a> in Apple&#8217;s market perceptions. Some of my favorite excerpts:</p>

<p>On Steve Jobs&#8217; departure from Apple:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The threat is negligible. During the first departure of Jobs, the intention of management was to make the company into “a proper company.” The plan was, essentially, to remove the chaotic model that Jobs had put in place and replace it with something more “rational” and “grown up.” After he returned he set about not just returning the company to the way it was but to also codifying and identifying exactly what that was so that it did not happen again. You have to appreciate that the greatest thing Jobs ever created was not a product but Apple itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On Apple&#8217;s <em>perceived</em> lack of innovation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A better way to think about Apple is to think about Pixar. It’s a blockbuster manufacturer. It makes blockbusters and nothing else. That means it does not make many of them and not always regularly and that the ideas may not be original, but the results are always very popular. Pixar is not like any other studio that makes some hits and some flops. Pixar is also a functional organization. It’s not an accident that they were both built by the same person and that they are both successful after he left.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When asked if he was Cook:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’d buy Intel and turn them into Apple’s microprocessor design and manufacturing group. They won’t have much to do in a few years and they’ll be cheap.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have a major crush on this guy!</p>
