title: Apple and gravitational lensing

summary: Agarners more attention than any Hollywood celebrity or any single entity of our era. Maybe it's just a biased perception as I very deliberately avoid any and all kinds of celebrity gossips and read a little too much of Apple news. But, it's not entirely an illusion. Even the tiniest little bit that concerns the company can be found on the front pages of newspapers around the globe, at least in the developed and the developing world.

This is great for the company. One can't even begin to quantify the monetary value of such media coverage. Before a product launches, the speculation and rumormongering escalate to such levels that even "normal" people know when a new iPhone or iPad is coming out. They might even have a cursory idea of what to expect. This is unprecedented.

There is a very neat consequence of General relativity, called Gravitational Lensing. To summarize: light coming from a distant star bends around a massive object, like a black-hole or a huge aggregate of dark matter. When the bent light reaches us, we, assuming that light traces straight paths, believe that the star is somewhere else on the horizon than it actually is. The gist of the analogy that I'm trying to construct here is that light bends due to mass and presents us with a distorted version of reality.

Attached to Apple's glam is a shadow that has only grown darker over time. Thousands and thousands of bloggers, analysts and vocal commenters focus all of their energy on covering Apple. This mass of attention serves a purpose analogous to a gravitational lens and distorts the reality that reaches people. Inconsequential happenings become headlines. Every product launch in recent history has been declared a failure by these self-proclaimed "pundits", curtesy of such non-occurrences as dropping a bar of cellular signal, a purple flare in the otherwise amazing camera, a slight heating of the back of some product or the ever-disappointing failure on Apple's part to meet "expectations". However, sales stay unaffected. The moment people hold these devices in their hands and use them for a while, those blog posts start to appear as utter nonsense. This trend speaks of the disconnect between the presented and actual realities of Apple.

Tech media and its belief that Apple's doomsday stories are a swift ticket to fame and page-views is detrimental to this one-of-a-kind company and more so, tech media itself. Journalists are trained to stay unbiased and present the most neutral picture possible. But most tech "journalists" appear to be far from this ideal. Cyclic conclusions, unfounded arguments and disproportionate criticism are rampant across thousands of posts that follow any product release. Opinions and editorials sound like illogical rants. Specimina of pure stupidity.

In the Wintel era, most electronics were marketed to geeks and bore inscrutable product numbers, followed by, detailed technical specifications. This made no sense at all to regular consumers. To make purchasing decisions, people relied on reviewers to explain how particular aspects of a product affected them and were they of any value. Apple, in it's multitude of ad campaigns, took the onus of educating the customers themselves and conveying a very different idea: how the product felt, worked and could be used. This has largely eliminated the "please explain me what the hell this means" value of reviews. As far as Apple devices are concerned, people ask for them by name. If they need help in deciding which one of the various models to buy, they trust their friends or the Apple-store staff. Thus, tech sites have lost an important role and are incessantly attempting to fulfill that void by taking the sensationalist route. Making scandals out of little defects, writing a few words wrapped within bold headlines and disproportionately criticizing Apple for incompetency has become the new norm.

I believe that there is so much to be learnt from Apple. There are so many things that they get right and put incredible amount of thought into making their products. There is no company that cares more, for its products or customers. It would only be logical if tech media took some those lessons and cared to deliver a transparent and logical story to their readers or it's their readership to lose.
