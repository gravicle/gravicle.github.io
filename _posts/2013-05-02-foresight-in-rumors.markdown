<p>John Moltz (<a href="http://verynicewebsite.net/">Very Nice Web Site</a> fame) <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2036307/the-sad-state-of-apple-rumors.html">writes</a> about the sate of Apple rumors today and the &#8220;glory days&#8221; of the iPhone/iPad stories:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s a weird time for those of us who’ve followed Apple rumors for years. (And I&#8217;m not the only one <a href="http://www.muleradio.net/thetalkshow/37/">who has noticed</a>.) At the risk of sounding like your prototypical hipster, today’s rumors just aren’t as good as they used to be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given that Apple rumors are a full-time job for so many bloggers, and form a significant portion of tech-news coverage, it is worth thinking over their state of being. As Moltz points out, most rumors today, the iWatch, the iRing, the iCar, are just not that fun<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a>. I believe I know why.</p>

<h3>The era of the obvious</h3>

<p>When the iPhone and the iPad rumors were gaining traction, these then-rumored products seemed like very plausible successors to the iPod. With the iPod, Apple made one of the most important aspects of computing mobile: music. As it grew into an increasingly more capable device, it became indispensable alongside cellphones. Looking back, it seems logical that Apple would pursue to unify those two things<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a>. The iPad was a long-rumored, fictional device which seemed an obvious extension of the iPhone past 2007. These logical insights made mulling over them for years fruitful. The theme here is that the bygone &#8220;legendary&#8221; decade of rumors was built on top of the obvious. Today, nothing is.</p>

<h3>What&#8217;s next? Who knows!</h3>

<p>Today, there seems to be a consensus that the next phase in consumer-technology is wearable-tech. Google is pursuing it with half-assed<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a> glasses. There seems to be an increased interest in fitness-tracking devices with startups leading the charge. But, if one tries to extrapolate, there doesn&#8217;t seem to be an obvious line of progress. This is not unlike before the iPod was announced. In Moltz&#8217;s words:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, if you were paying attention, you might have noticed that I left out one highly successful Apple product of the 2000s, a device that wasn’t part of the rumor trinity: the iPod. The iPod came out in October of 2001 and was something of a surprise to everybody. Rumors of an Apple digital music player had only sprung up about a week before it was unveiled. Before any of those storied Apple rumors above came to fruition, we got a product that wasn’t rumored at all. And, I don’t know if you noticed, but the iPod turned out pretty OK.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But what about rumor-sites? Well, they seem utterly clueless. They are chasing after anything and everything that comes out of east-Asia or an analyst&#8217;s mouth. Not the most reliable sources, I say. There is no clear trajectory in sight so, no weights are assigned to any particular category of rumors. This makes everything, from <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/04/04/is-this-apples-itv-screen-ipad-and-iring/">asinine</a> to <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2012/05/bigger_display_iphone_thing_wwdc">plausible</a>, equally (un)important. This is distracting and inhibits deeper thought<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[4]</a>. Speculations are shallow and analysis is bleak. This ought to make any reporting insipid. And that is where we are.</p>

<p>So, is this lack of &#8220;good&#8221; rumors a sign of the fabled doomsday for Apple<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[5]</a>? I will let Moltz tell you:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, while we might be flying blind right now, don’t assume that means Apple has nothing planned. And don’t assume that what is planned is anything you’ve heard as a rumor. Before the iPod came out, nobody had any idea what it was. Before the iPhone came out, no one had any idea what it would look like, let alone how transformative it would be. A year before the iPad came out, people were speculating about an Apple netbook, for crying out loud.</p>
