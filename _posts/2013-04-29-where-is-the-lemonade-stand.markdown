<p>This week, My friends <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewjclark">Andrew Clark</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/zcichy">Zac Cichy</a> invited me over to their new and amazing podcast, <a href="http://themenubar.net">The Menu Bar</a>. This was my first podcast ever and I had fun doing it.</p>

<p>We talked a bit about the future of computing and data, Apple&#8217;s fabled iWatch, and my take on <a href="http://www.ulyssesapp.com/">Ulysses III</a>.</p>

<p>I am really grateful that they invited me over, especially as their first-ever guest. These guys are pretty amazing and there is a lot more to come. I suggest you subscribe to the Podcast in <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-menu-bar/id635741483?mt=2">iTunes</a> as well as follow it on <a href="https://twitter.com/themenubar">Twitter</a>.</p>
