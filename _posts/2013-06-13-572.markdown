Apple takes its time to get to things. Not because of bureaucracy slowing processes down but because “There are a thousand no’s for every yes”. So, instead of coming up with defensive explanations of why iOS doesn’t do a seemingly logical and useful thing, (and then watch them do so next year<a class="footnote" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" href="#fn:1">[1]</a>) just believe that they must not have gotten to doing it yet.
<div class="footnotes">

<hr />

<ol>
	<li id="fn:1">iPad Mini, 4-inch iPhone 5, pull-to-refresh, swipe-right to go back (shhhh! NDA) etc. <a class="reversefootnote" title="return to article" href="#fnref:1"> ↩</a></li>
</ol>
</div>
