<p>Generally I use <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wolframalpha/id334989259?mt=8">Wolfram Alpha</a> or a simple google query for my data manipulation needs. This includes currency, units and time conversions. On the mac, more often than not, I have <a href="http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/">Mathematica</a> running or the built-in dashboard widget does the trick<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>However, something is to be done about frequent conversions where it&#8217;s too slow to set up an &#8220;xUSD to INR&#8221; query in Wolfram Alpha or Google. Currency conversion is one such task. Apps that try to do too much and convert to everything from everything are slow as they need to be setup each time for a particular conversion. Hence, I downloaded this one-trick-<a href="https://twitter.com/SteveStreza/status/363289089123946496">pony</a> featured in the &#8220;Finance&#8221; section of the Appstore.</p>

<h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/currency-simple-converter/id628148586?mt=8">Currency</a></h3>

<p>The app is very good looking and responsive. Here's an overview of the aspects I like: </p>

<ul>
<li>Very cool number-manipulation gestures. Just swipe right to delete and left to bring things back.</li>
<li>Tap the graph key or swipe right on the num-pad to reveal a 6 months long history of the exchange rate<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a>.</li>
<li>Quickly prioritize other currencies and add new ones.</li>
<li>Just tap on the target currency to swap places and do reverse conversions.</li>
</ul>

I recorded a video to showcase the app.<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a>.</p>

<p>The features are very well balanced and weighted in their complexity of access by their relative importance. Manipulating numbers, the most frequent task, is extremely easy and intuitive and so is swapping currencies. Additional currencies are hidden under num-pad, avoiding clutter while still keeping them close at hand. Searching, a rare operation after initial setup, is out of focus until one needs it. It requires hiding the num-pad and then pulling down.</p>

<p>A balanced, focused, and quick app to convert currencies. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/currency-simple-converter/id628148586?mt=8">Buy</a> it from the AppStore for $0.99.</p>

<p>I always forget about <a href="http://www.acqualia.com/soulver/">Soulver</a>. It handles conversions very well. <a href="#fnref:1" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

<p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/gravicle/status/363330736889135105">discovered</a> that iOS 7 Î² allows mirroring without the persistent (and annoying) blue-bar. It makes screen recordings very clean. <a href="#fnref:2" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

<li id="fn:3">
<p>A very handy way to monitor currency exchange rates from iOS&#8217; Notification Center is to add the string <code>USDINR=x</code>, where the latter symbol is the one you want to convert to, to the <a href=" http://spinhalf.net/?attachment_id=652">Stocks app</a>. <a href="#fnref:3" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>
