<p>AnandTech <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/6993/intel-iris-pro-5200-graphics-review-core-i74950hq-tested">reviews</a> the next generation of Intel Haswell graphics, the Intel Iris Pro 5200. It is the prime candidate for this week&#8217;s (speculated) MacBook Pro Retina refresh with i7&#8211;4850HQ at 2.3GHz and i7&#8211;4950HQ at 2.4GHZ base clock speeds.</p>

<p>The Iris pro seems to be quite competent at non-gaming use and performs extremely well in comparison with other integrated GPUs. While Intel seems to have made quite a stride in GPU performance with Haswell, the Iris Pro does&#8217;t even touch NVIDIA&#8217;s current generation 650M at high quality gaming while the 750M looms on the horizon. For all intents and purposes, gaming is still a turf dominated by discreet, power hungry silicon. But, I am not interested in gaming performance. For me the only important thing is how well these dies perform in Apple&#8217;s notebooks while handling web-browsing and development workloads.</p>

<h3>MacBook Pro 15 with Retina Display</h3>

<p>Apple&#8217;s MacBook Pro 15 with Retina display is an incredibly capable machine. I have been using the notebook for an year now and it performs like no other computer I have ever used and it looks <strong>great</strong> while doing so. It has better battery life than my 2012 Air did. Over the past year my workload as a web developer has increased significantly and the device breezes thru hundreds of open files and windows and sessions. Switching between enormous apps is instantaneous and there is no slowdown, almost ever. I cannot be happier with it.</p>

<p>What will Haswell do to it? While the CPU performance gains are modest in Haswell, it&#8217;s the GPU that&#8217;s going to be the rockstar. Not because it might be better than the 650M but because it is <em>so</em> much better than the integrated 4000HD which the rMBP currently ships with. The 4000 drives the retina display and OS X&#8217;s plush animations well enough but the device switches to the discreet 650M quite often and for many apps. This is not user-noticeable but does hit the battery performance. As Anandtech <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/6993/intel-iris-pro-5200-graphics-review-core-i74950hq-tested/20">puts it</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In our 15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina Display review we found that simply having the discrete GPU enabled could reduce web browsing battery life by ~25%. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This will go away with Haswell and the power consumption gains will be significant.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>TDP is half of the story with Iris Pro, because the CPU, GPU and eDRAM all fit into the same 47W power envelope. With a discrete GPU, like the 650M, you end up with an extra 45W on top of the CPU’s TDP.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the current CPUs in the rMBP have a TDP of 45W under maximum load. Haswell ought to give a significant boost to battery life (or allow Apple to reduce the physical profile of the notebooks while still managing better battery life than the 2012 Pros).</p>

<p>So, for the 15&#8220; rMBP, Haswell will bring almost discreet-GPU levels of performance in an integrated, low power Iris Pro. However, it is the 13&#8221; rMBP that is slated to be revolutionized here.</p>

<h3>Macbook Pro 13 with Retina Display- Reborn</h3>

<p>Macbook Pro 13 with Retina Display is an odd machine. It lacks a discreet GPU and leaves the task of driving the immense 227ppi 2560×1600 display to the underpowered and paltry Intel HD 4000. This want of transistors bleeds in choppy animations and sluggish scrolling across applications. When asked for a recommendation, rMBP 13 2012 is something I advise people to skid away from. Haswell will change the game for this unfortunate cousin of the 15.</p>

<p>What Iris Pro means for the 13&#8220; rMBP is 650M levels of performance, all the time, while actually shrinking the power envelope. In short, Haswell will make the 13&#8221; rMBP a real notebook.</p>

<p>I am excited for this refresh and have made arrangements to upgrade to the the newer 15&quot; rMBP as soon as it launches. </p>

<p>And now, we <a href="http://spinhalf.net/?attachment_id=565">wait</a> for WWDC!</p>

<h3>Side Note on MacBook Airs</h3>

<p>MacBook Airs use 17W TDP &#8220;<a href="http://hothardware.com/Reviews/Core-i53427U-Ultra-Low-Voltage-Ivy-Bridge-For-Ultrabooks/">UltraBook</a>&#8221; processors. The mid 2012 Airs used the i5&#8211;3427U processors with Intel HD 4000 integrated GPU units clocked at <a href="http://ark.intel.com/products/64903/">350MHz</a>, almost half of what the units used in the 13&quot; rMBP, which clock at <a href="http://ark.intel.com/products/64900">650MHz</a>. Even while moving to Haswell, the integrated GPU (HD4400) is a <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/7047/the-haswell-ultrabook-review-core-i74500u-tested/7">modest improvement</a> over the HD4000. </p>

<p>Given that the 650MHz HD4000 from the much higher 45W TDP CPUs can barely drive the 13&quot; Retina Display, there is no practical possibility of the Airs featuring a Retina Display with any 17W TDP CPU in the immediate future.</p>
