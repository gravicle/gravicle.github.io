<p>It is very difficult to quantify, but Apple has an incredible impact on the design community. Most of the design in software (and by derivation, on the web) is inspired by AppStore trends which, in turn, are a function of the Apple design language. The explanation is simple: Apple ushered-in the era of carefully crafted and beautifully designed software and stands to be the gravitational well of fashion in UI design.</p>

<p>With iOS 7, Apple is starting a new parallel of interactive and content-focused design. I am really excited for iOS and how it turns out to be, but a lot more than that, I am excited for all the apps which beg a re-imagination on iOS7.</p>

<p>UI designers will have a busy summer. No, not redoing their apps but learning new things. This earmarks the departure of rich visual design and calls for efficient and simple presentation of information through minimalist and thoughtful design.</p>

<p>The only thing bigger than this to ever happen on the platform was when Apple actually <em>created</em> the platform in 2008.</p>
