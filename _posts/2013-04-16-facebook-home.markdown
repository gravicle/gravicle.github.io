<p>I have been wondering consistently about Facebook Home. <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Adaringfireball.net+%22Facebook+Home%22">Much</a> has been said about it by very smart people and I did not believe I had much to add to it. However, today, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/mike-matas/21/b3b/a53">Mike Matas</a>, a UI designer at Facebook and former Apple Human Interface Designer, <a href="https://twitter.com/mike_matas/status/324186555390513154">tweeted</a> about Loren Brichter joining <em>his team</em> at Facebook. I find it extremely interesting and an insightful data point into Facebook&#8217;s vision.</p>

<p>Here is my take on Facebook Home.</p>

<h3>The Intensions</h3>

<p>Ever since its conception, Facebook has been a desktop product. Their major &#8220;innovations&#8221;, even as recent as the <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/2/29/2832844/facebook-timeline-for-businesses">Facebook Timeline</a> and the <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/15/3879520/facebook-tackles-google-linkedin-yelp-graph-search">Graph Search</a> are desktop-first experiences. With the rise of the iPhone and the mobile-revolution that followed it, Facebook took <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-ipads-not-mobile-2010-11">some</a> <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/11/watch-techcrunch-disrupt-sf-live-2/">missteps</a> and mobile became Facebook&#8217;s Achilles-heel. So much so that it was <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/computing/116661-facebooks-only-weakness-mobile">documented</a> as the &#8220;only weakness&#8221; in the risk clause of their SEC IPO filings. Home is an effort to correct that.</p>

<p>David Pogue <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/11/technology/personaltech/facebooks-grab-for-your-phone-what-gives.html?ref=technology&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">analyzes</a> the various facets of Facebook home and the rationale behind them for the NY Times. At the heart of it, Home puts Facebook front and center for mobile users and defines their mobile use around their own (Facebook) friends. For Facebook, home is a bright canvas for ads, the primary commodity in Facebook&#8217;s business model. It is so at two levels:</p>

<ul>
<li>As the primary UI on Android, home is a very visual and visible space for ads.</li>
<li>Home, live on millions of phones, would be a major source of data on user behaviors and preferences. This would help Facebook advance its ad-targeting algorithms and sell even more ads in the future.</li>
</ul>

<p>The intensions are clear. Home is a way to <a href="http://thenextweb.com/facebook/2013/04/04/zuckerberg-no-ads-in-home-yet-but-will-come-to-coverfeed-eventually/">push ads</a> to where the consumers are, on mobile.</p>

<h3>Home, today</h3>

<h4>Android</h4>

<p>Home is fundamentally a launcher replacement for Android. It is an ingenious, albeit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Android_launchers">not an original</a>, approach. Launchers have existed on the Google Play store for quite a while.</p>

<h4>iOS</h4>

<p>Immediately following its launch, <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2013/04/04/will-facebook-home-ever-come-to-ios-zuckerberg-says-it-would-require-apple-partnership/">articles</a> speculating the arrival of Home on iOS started appearing. <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/222454/how-facebook-home-screws-apple/">Some</a> also chose to write asinine shit about how Home and its absence from iOS will be <em>the</em> nail in Apple&#8217;s coffin. (Over at Coyote Tracks, Watts Martin&#8217;s piece on the &#8220;<a href="http://tracks.ranea.org/post/47791661856/the-default-narrative">Default Narrative</a>&#8221; is my new go-to URL to explain all the inane shit that is written about Apple). Anyway, Home is not coming to iOS. I do not need any rumors or reports to infer that. But that is Apple&#8217;s stance. What about Facebook?</p>

<p>Facebook&#8217;s intensions still stand. iOS is the next turf, a very strictly regulated one at that. The obvious course of action today is to enhance their AppStore apps to make Facebook experience better on iOS. <strong>UPDATE</strong>: <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/16/4230274/facebook-6-0-for-ipad-and-iphone-hands-on-with-chat-heads-stickers">and that&#8217;s what they are doing</a>. But the future is more interesting.</p>

<h3>Home, tomorrow</h3>

<p>Matt Drance, the Apple Outsider, <a href="http://www.appleoutsider.com/2013/04/05/home-turf/">outlined</a> the logical course for Facebook Home on Android and beyond.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You make your competitor’s system yours — overnight. Facebook Home is a trojan horse designed to steal the Android experience, and the Android user base, right out of Google’s hands. The majority of speculation over the last year or two had been that Facebook was working on its own mobile OS. </p>

<p>Facebook Home will provide a halo effect to current Android users that warms them up to a full-blown “Facebook phone” in the years to come. It gives Facebook the experience, confidence, credibility, momentum, and time to build a better and broader mobile experience than they would have been able to build otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe that its naive to consider that Facebook is not working on its own OS. Besides Facebook Home being a loud declaration of such intensions, the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/10/has-facebook-quietly-acquired-osmeta-a-stealth-mobile-software-startup/">recent acquisition of Osmeta</a> and <a href="http://www.quora.com/Facebook-Acquisitions/Who-are-the-best-designers-to-have-joined-Facebook-via-acquisition">Facebook&#8217;s hiring</a> of some of industry&#8217;s best designers are subtler indications of the same.</p>

<p>Would a Facebook OS be a fork of Android? John Siracusa, in the <a href="http://atp.fm/episodes/8-hold-me">8th episode of the Accidental Tech Podcast</a>, very comprehensively laid down what it takes to be able to fork an open source OS and Facebook is not there. Yet. However, time is crucial for Facebook and I believe that instead of being relegated to Android until they have their own OS, they will plan a deeper heist into iOS.</p>

<p>This is why Loren Brichter&#8217;s hire is a very curious one to me. Besides being an incredible designer, Brichter is an interactions frontiersman. Pull-to-refresh has made into iOS, Letterpress&#8217; playful tiles are front and center on Apple&#8217;s <a href="http://www.apple.com">homepage</a>. And Letterpress is not just another app. As GigaOm <a href="http://gigaom.com/2012/12/03/loren-brichter-designs-on-the-future-of-ios-apps/">explains</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The sole employee and proprietor of Atebits, Brichter is among the smartest and most innovative user interface developers working on Apple’s mobile platform today. That’s why Letterpress, though a well-designed amusement to fill downtime, is for him is not really a game but “a Trojan Horse” for an extremely ambitious — or as he put it to me, “insane” — experiment with the future of how graphics are displayed on a mobile device. </p>

<p>He built his own version of the user interface framework, the software that sits right above the graphics processor on an iOS device. Apple creates that for developers — it was completely unnecessary for him to do this. But this is the kind of thing he considers “fun.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Facebook is laying incredible emphasis on interactions in its design language. <a href="https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/af182add5a2f">This Medium</a> by Julie Zhuo, a Product Design Director at Facebook, sheds some light on the emphasis Facebook puts on interaction-design. Assuming this will be true in the immediate future, Brichter&#8217;s hire indicates that there is lot more coming to iOS than the current app. I believe that in the coming months, we will see Facebook creating custom UI frameworks for iOS resulting in a one-of-its-kind experience on the platform, enticing users with playful and fluid UI.</p>

<p>There is another reason for which this might be a good idea. I am still formulating my thoughts on inter-app-communication in iOS. But, I think that a very plausible route for apple will be to introduce <strong>app-sheets</strong>, similar to those that Mail.app or <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/02/good-news-for-discovery-apps-apple-allows-apps-to-sell-other-apps-directly-in-ios-6/">AppStore</a> uses. Upon requesting an action, instead of switching to a different app, that app could serve a custom sheet with its own UI to complete the task. If this comes to fruition, Facebook, with its custom interaction designs and UI, can almost replicate the Android Home experience on iOS. If not, they could take another route where a <strong>UI-Library</strong> would enable other apps to call Facebook&#8217;s interactions and sharing inside of them. </p>

<h3>The Hacker Way</h3>

<p>Facebook is digging deeper into mobile. They are learning and hacking their way through. Home on Android is a concealed attack on Google, from their own turf. It will serve as a test of Google&#8217;s supposedly &#8220;open&#8221; ethos and Facebook&#8217;s ingenuity. iOS will be even more trying and will only fall to never-before-conceived &#8220;hacks&#8221;.</p>
