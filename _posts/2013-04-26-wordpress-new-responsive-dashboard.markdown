I develop mostly on top of Wordpress. Most importantly, because it gives clients the ability to change things without touching the code and creating a maintenance-scare every time they delete "that weird looking thing". So, I am pretty excited about Wordpress' new responsive and good-looking dashboard. It is still under development but you can install a plugin to enable it right now.
