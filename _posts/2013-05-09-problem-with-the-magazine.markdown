<p>I have been wondering about the state of Marco Arment&#8217;s <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3690167/how-can-one-invoke-a-keyboard-shortcut-from-within-an-applescript">The Magazine</a> lately and wanted to write about it. However, <a href="https://twitter.com/NathanJLiu">Nathan Liu</a> beat me to it. As Nathan <a href="http://remarked.co/683/the-problem-with-the-magazine/">puts it</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8230;articles are too ‘out there’, too niche, and have recently failed to grab my wandering attention. When I get into an article, I always enjoy it, even if it is about something I never would usually read about, but these niche topics have to compete with the entirety of the web, which happens to sit right alongside it on the iPad. They just aren’t enticing, and there are other pieces I’d rather read, and topics I’d prefer to study.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To which, The Magazine&#8217;s editor <a href="https://twitter.com/GlennF">Glenn Fleishman</a> responded in comments:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Marco started the Magazine to offer writing that wasn’t precisely found everywhere else. Over time, we’ve evolved to what you’re saying: trying to find subjects for a readership that is inured to and maybe tired of finding an infinity of topics (often rehashed) that have a specific appeal to their existing interests. We’re billed now as for “curious people,” and that’s true. Without putting us in the same league as the New Yorker, I would argue that is what it does well and we aspire to: to surprise people even with ordinary subjects, and to enlighten people about stuff they simply don’t know about.</p>
