<p>Today was Apple&#8217;s quarterly earnings call. Apple is stronger than ever as a business and stands to be the most remarkable technology company of our time. What Apple is not is a hedge fund.</p>

<p>Apple&#8217;s cash-stash is astonishing. I remember getting wide-eyed reading about all what could be done with the money. <a href="http://thingsappleisworthmorethan.tumblr.com">This fun Tumblr</a> just puts things in perspective, as we regular folks tend to lose grip on things past a few million dollars. When Apple was growing a 100% every year, doubling in size that is, it was baffling. All that &#8220;bafflement&#8221; created pageviews and somehow tech-journalists began to think of themselves as <em>analysts</em>. Days leading to this earnings call saw blogger after blogger spinning baseless statistics and rumors about the fabled doom of Apple. There was talk of &#8216;profit-shares&#8217;, &#8216;p/e ratios&#8217;, &#8216;dividends&#8217;, &#8216;Wall Street&#8217;, &#8216;market-share&#8217;, and every other term that could be googled. Pardon me. I am certain these people took care to thoroughly research and grasp the nuances and conventions used in these these definitions, and went through the trouble of verifying the accuracy of their data and projections. And they most certainly did not just overhear all of this, gave up on recalling Econ&#8211;101 and hit publish. Nope.</p>

<p>Anyway, Apple is not a hedge-fund. So, <strong>why</strong> are these <em>tech-</em>journalists covering it like it is one? It is certainly important to be vigilant about the gross health of Apple as a business. This affects their ability to deliver great products. However, quarterly fluctuations in profit-margins, dividends and Apple&#8217;s immediate stock-price are <a href="http://spinhalf.net/aapl/">irrelevant metrics</a>, unless your readers are investors. And, if you are reading 9to5Mac<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> for investment advice, <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Adaringfireball.net+%22I+have+a+bridge+to+sell+you%22">I have a bridge to sell you</a>. Apple is very amusing and interesting to think and talk about but it is not a teen pop-star on raging hormones feeding the paparazzi with its hijinks. Apple is a vision to humanize technology. Selling it as a cheap street-show is sickening.</p>

<p>Technology journalism, today, is everything but that. I suggest, we let smart lads like Horace Dediu ponder over the business. An occasional link to <a href="http://asymco.com">asymco.com</a> sans sensational headlines will be super.</p>
