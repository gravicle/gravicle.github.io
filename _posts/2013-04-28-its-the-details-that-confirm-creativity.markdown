<p>A very smart take on the &#8220;idea man&#8221; by Andy Rutledge:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Creative people have a robust capacity for creation. They create. They finish. To finish you’ve got to be good with the details. In fact, creativity is the ability to clearly perceive details that are invisible to others. It’s the details that confirm the creativity.</p>
