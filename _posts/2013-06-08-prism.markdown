To me, Prism's existence isn't incredible, its scale is.

NSA's prime defense against privacy concerns is internal auditing and their technical inability to process all the collected data. Government auditing itself is self-contradictory and as for technical difficulties, big-data processing is tracing an extreme curve today and it's only a matter of time, and a short one at that, when they can start making meaningful and identifiable inferences form emails and text archives.

Privacy is just a dream.
