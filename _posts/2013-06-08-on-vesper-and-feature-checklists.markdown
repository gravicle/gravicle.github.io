title: On Vesper and Feature Checklists

<p>A couple of days ago, a new note-taking app surfaced in the AppStore, <a href="itunes://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vesper/id655895325?mt=8&amp;uo=4">Vesper</a>. Attached to it were some big names in the tech journalism scene. Following the release, almost instantaneously, the app was all what everyone was talking about. Curiously, it shipped without an iPad version, a Mac client or at least Dropbox (or any, for that matter) sync. I am sure that it will get those things right in the next release. However, it invited a lot of bother, partly from disgruntled developers who perceived the coverage as unfair and partly from &#8220;friends-of-the-app&#8221; disparaging the said developers and some legitimate naysayers. A big argument in favor of the app was that it&#8217;s lack of features is a feature and an indicator of the possession of some metaphorical &#8220;<a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/06/07/marco-vesper">balls</a>&#8221; and anyone to think otherwise was plummeting into the ghastly dungeons of checklists. This is inane and illogical. </p>

<p>Feature checklists are little monsters that refuse to die. More so, it&#8217;s the fear of their revival that drives some crazy. However, they were indispensable tools only a few years ago.</p>

<p>Having defeated Apple in the PC wars, Microsoft went on to encourage and very fastidiously incentivize commoditization of the PC hardware. It brought prices down and drove sales. While the OEMs were grappling onto the last slivers of margin, windows licenses made MS one of the biggest corporations on the planet. This commoditization left little room for experience driven products and OEMs fought to differentiate their offerings with &quot;features<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a>. Naturally, comparison checklists were everywhere.</p>

<p>Today, when Apple implements a feature, it&#8217;s very well thought-out and of value to a lot of users<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a>. iOS and OS X are mostly free of gimmicks to trick users into choosing these platforms<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a>. This is an example of experience driven product philosophy. When one buys an Apple device they are promised a seamless, Just Worksâ„¢, experience. They don&#8217;t have to go thru every single feature and compare it with rival offerings. It&#8217;s simple. And the simplicity carries with it the implicit idea of the product being feature complete to drive the said experience. This is why checklists are obsolete for Apple and Apple-inspired companies.</p>

<p>Circling back to Vesper, it&#8217;s very fair to complain about the lack of essential aspects like sync and data portability from a notes app. A $4.99<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[4]</a> one at that. It might get sync sorted out soon and in a few months there might be companion iPad and Mac apps as well, but today, it stands to have none. We buy into a product for what it is today, not for what it could be someday<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[5]</a>. The experience isn&#8217;t complete and this calls for an analysis of the cause of it. Hence the feature checklists. </p>

<p>No one is reverting to the savage old times of the PC era here. And that is all.</p>

<p>Not quite unlike the commoditized Android market today. <a href="#fnref:1" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

<p>A great example is NFC. Despite very vocal supporters of the nascent technology and competitors&#8217; perceived edge, Apple did not waste resources on it. Come WWDC 2013 and the fancy is dead. <a href="#fnref:2" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

<p>$4.99 is not pricey but being above the median price, it carries with it the expectation of a complete, well-executed experience.  <a href="#fnref:4" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>
